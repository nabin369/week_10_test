Week 10 test
============

Task:
-----
     Let's create an Rails app that allows the user to keep the count of how many times they logged into the app. Not terribly useful but good for practice.

* It will have the following functionality:
* The homepage will explain what the app does and have login and sign up forms
* The sign up form will be submitted via ajax using jQuery
* If the sign up is successful, it'll show the corresponding message (as part of the page)
* If the sign up is not successful (empty username or password, duplicate username), it will show a message as well
* The user should be able to log in after it has signed up. A successful login will redirect to another page that will show the count of how many times the user has logged in
* An unsuccessful login will show an error message without reloading the page
* This page will have a log out button or link. If the user clicks it, it will show a message saying goodbye
* If a user is already logged it, the home page should automatically redirect to the logged in page

Implementation:
---------------

* Please have acceptance tests for the app. Write them first
* Deploy to heroku. Make sure it works there (you'll need to add necessary add ons)
* Validate your HTML with http://validator.w3.org/. Try to fix the errors it may show
* Validate your CSS with http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/. Try to fix the errors it may show
* Validate your JS with http://www.jslint.com/. Try to fix the errors it may show
* Finally, make your app look good. It's just a couple of pages with the most basic functionality. Make an attempt at web design but don't overcomplicate it
